Thanks if you want to help the project, I really appreciate it.

# Installing the project locally

Please, use Yarn, not NPM, the project uses `yarn.lock`, not `package-lock.json`.

# How to open a dev server

Use `yarn serve`, this opens a dev serven on localhost:8080.

You will see a menu with the buttons "Dev 1", "Dev 2"... (routes with `/#/dev/` prefix)

Click on one of the links to open the currently developed component, on each page the component is used in its own way.

# After work done

## Build

No need to do a build (`yarn build`), I'll do it myself.

## Git

After the changes are made, use the `commit` script to commit the changes (`yarn commit`). This project uses [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and [conventional changelog standard](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog).
